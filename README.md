# queue-bot
Generic basic queue bot made using JavaScript &amp; Puppeteer. 

Change link & number of instances to run in package.json.

Bot is currently quite inefficient - manually check to see how many sessions you can run.

If it detects a change in URL, opens up a window where the page is loaded up, and from there you can manually checkout.
